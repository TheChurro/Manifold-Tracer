# Manifold-Tracer

This is aimed to be a real-time path-tracer which can trace paths through triangulated three manifolds.

###### RaytracingInOneWeekend and RayTracingNextWeek
This segment of the project was an initial learning phase where I implemented a basic raytracer. This code follows the implementation of Peter Shirley in his books "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" and "Ray Tracing the Next Week." (https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io/tree/master)
