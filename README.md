# Manifold-Tracer

This is aimed to be a real-time path-tracer which can trace paths through triangulated three manifolds.

# Branches

###### RaytracingInOneWeekend and RayTracingNextWeek
This segment of the project was an initial learning phase where I implemented a basic raytracer. This code follows the implementation of Peter Shirley in his books "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" and "Ray Tracing the Next Week." (https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io/tree/master)

###### gpu_implementation
This branch is a major rewrite of the raytracer, beginning a gpu implementation using OpenCL. This implementations follows more closely to that of "Physically Based Rendering(http://www.pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/contents.html)" and "Lighthouse 2 (https://github.com/jbikker/lighthouse2)."
